This two sum program has a specified target and goes through a given array of integers to find the two values that add together that sum up to the target. The program sorts the array, using the quicksort method, so that it's easier to find duplicates of the same number and then they are removed from the array using the removeDuplicates function. Once the duplicates are removed, the program goes through the findTS to find the two sum values that add to each other to equal the target. If there are no two integers that add together that aren't duplicates of each other, the program will print "No Solution." Otherwise, the program will print the two numbers that add to each other to meet the target.
